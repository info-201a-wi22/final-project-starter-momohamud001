## What is this file for?

Abstract:
This project examines the (under/mis) representation of female actors in the movie industry. Using the Bechdel Test, we observe the trends between how profitable a movie is depending on its Bechdel Test score, which of the three test requirements have the highest number of failed results, and how Bechdel Test scores have changed between 1950-2021. This topic is important because media plays a substantial role in creating and upholding gender norms that get translated into stereotypes embedded in our daily culture. Once these areas have been studied, we can apply it to larger questions begging critical thinking such as how stereotypes of women in films effect their ability to attain key roles.

Introduction:
Female Representation on the Big Screen is centered around the idea that female actors are not given equal representation on screen in films. Our aim is to use the Bechdel Test as a way to study the patterns of misrepresentation of females in the movie industry. Created by Alison Bechdel in 1985, the Bechdel Test is still relevant today and measures representation by checking three criteria:

1. The movie must have at least 2 [named] female characters
2. Who talk to each other
3. About something other than a man. 
In Hollywood, for example, the majority of A-list actors, directors, and writers are men. This has led to their biases of women tainting the film industry and affecting broader issues such as unequal pay, key roles, and the reinforcement of stereotypes. We all have our favourite female actors or even directors, but few people are aware of the lack of credit they receive and the major waste of potential simply due to Hollywood patriarchy.

Design Situation:

  Project Framing:The social issue this project aims to address is sexism, specifically when it comes to women in films. Sexism is portrayed through misrepresentation of women where stereotypes are maintained through continuous casting, directing, and script patterns. The project uses the Bechdel Test as a means of measuring the lack of representation and showing its changes over the decades. The project highlights how sexism is structural, and embedded within society through media and the capitalistic economy. 

  Human Values: The human values connected to this project include equality and equity when it comes to gender representation and treatment. Equality refers to all individuals receiving the same resources in same number, whereas equity refers to when specific circumstances of the individuals are considered and resources are allocated based on need. When it comes to finding a solution to the problem of women's representation, it is important increasingly make opportunities for women the same as men (equality), but also go one step further and think about how these opportunities can be efficiently given by effectively focusing on the interests of women first, not men and women together.   

  Direct and Indirect Stakeholders:
The direct stakeholders are the women in Hollywood who are being taken advantage of in all regards by men in power. From all levels in film-making, women of all skills and backgrounds are unfairly represented both economically (if they do not get prominent roles their pay is naturally lessened) as well as being attached to stereotypes that continue gendered ideas of women. The indirect stakeholders in our research would be movie goers and the public who subconsciously make assumptions about women and perpetuate stereotypes in their mind based on the film media they consume. Ultimately, this project and the issue it is addressing can only benefit society as a whole.

Harms and Benefits:
The benefits of this research will be that we will be able to see the inequality in the movie industry in data. It is easy to say that women are being discriminated against, but now there is data compiled to show hard evidence. Possible harm may come from male co-star frustration or conflict over who will be paid less or more. This harm is unimportant however, and ultimately there are no relavent harms that could come from gender equity.

Research Questions:
How profitable is a movie depending on its Bechdel Test score?
Unlike our prediction that the most popular films that did not pass the Bechdel Test would have the higher profit, we found no obvious correlation between profitability and Bechdel Test Score. Many popular films that passed the Bechdel Test were highly profitable and some were also not. For example, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 FAILED and had a profit of $78000000 and Despicable Me 2 PASSED with a similar profit of $76000000. 	 

Which of the three test requirements have the highest number of failed results?
The test requirement with the highest number of failed tests was women in the film who simply did not have a speaking role. This was surprising and unfortunate to learn because we had thought women would at least have the chance to talk, but maybe that it would mostly be about men. 

How have Bechdel Test scores changed between 1950-2021?


Application and Critical Thinking: How do stereotypes of women in films affect their ability to attain key roles?
This question is important because of the long standing belief that women cant be the star of movies unless there's a romantic element or that they have to be the ones being saved. This has long standing effects to young women that grow up thinking that it is all they will ever be. This also has effects on how directors and writers are picked as well as how much women are paid compared to their male counterparts.

The Dataset:
We used the Bechdel test for our data, and the Bechdel test measures the representation of women in fiction. The Bechdel test has three rules: that at least two women are featured, that these women talk to each other, and that they discuss something other than a man. We found an article that used the Bechdel test in female representation in movies, and they gave the article rates in order to figure out the female representation. The score could be one of three meanings: a rating of zero means the movie does not have at least two female presentations. a rating of one, it means that the film has two female actors, but they don't talk to each other. If it has a rating of two, the movie has two female actors, but they talk about men. If they have a three rating, they have two female actors, and they speak to each other and something other than men. We compared about 937 movies, and in our data, we broke it down by title, imdbid, id, rating, and year. If you go to the ratings, you will see which movies passed the Bechdel test and which movies failed the Bechdel test. One of the movies from 2021, called Black Widow, was based on a female superhero and passed the Bechdel test with a three, another movie, Men in Black: International, was based on two male characters, but they still passed the Bechdel test. Another trend we saw was that there is no evident link between a film's budget or income and its Bechdel score.thus, we came to the conclusion that the Bechdel test is not always the greatest way to assess female representation in films.

The movie set is our secondary source which is 1794 rows long and 15 column wide and covers a variety of topics such as budget and gross box office sales to women satisfactory role playing in movies. The who in this data set would be the women who played roles in these movies or not. Some observations I have made with this data is that the connections between the budget and the women's roles in movies and that is something we can really dive into to find how severe the difference is between the budget of movies with men main actors or women.

Expected Implications:
Our findings have the expected implication that women are still barred from high positions in the media and entertainment industries. This report could be a useful tool for those learning film production and directing or for the general public to be aware of the biases we still have regarding women. This research also has far-reaching implications beyond the film business. The study of historical patterns of female representation is, in and of itself, a very important and relevent subject of research. Our hypothesis is that our studies on films will provide substantial new insights into just how much women are under-represented in many other areas such as STEM, sports, marketing tactics, etc.

Limitations:
Some limitations that come with this project are the availability and locations of data, and the continuation of movie sagas. Some movies from our Bechdel data are from countries outside of North America, and thus the differences in gender norms and culture must be acknowledged. However, the values behind our project remain - female characters on-screen can be much more than just a love interest or a shallow, supporting character to a male lead and can increased dynamic representation can positively impact female viewers. Furthermore, movies that continue into sagas - like Twilight - can increase data that may pass or fail the Bechdel test and therefore potentially alter the comprehensive, bigger picture. This could be controlled if sagas were reduced to their title films, though this would also disqualify a saga and our data from representing any female character arcs, development, or decreased Bechdel passability like Pirates of the Caribbean.
