## What is this file for?

* This project will examine the (under/mis) representation of female actors in the movie industry. Using the Bechdel Test, we will observe the trends between how profitable a movie is depending on its Bechdel Test score, which of the three test requirements have the highest number of failed results, and how Bechdel Test scores have changed between 1950-2021. This topic is important because media plays a substantial role in creating and upholding gender norms that get translated into stereotypes embedded in our daily culture. Once these areas have been studied, we can apply it to larger questions begging critical thinking such as how stereotypes of women in films effect their ability to get key roles.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
