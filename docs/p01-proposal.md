## Abstract:

This project will examine the (under/mis) representation of female actors in the movie industry. Using the Bechdel Test, we will observe the trends between how profitable a movie is depending on its Bechdel Test score, which of the three test requirements have the highest number of failed results, and how Bechdel Test scores have changed between 1950-2021. This topic is important because media plays a substantial role in creating and upholding gender norms that get translated into stereotypes embedded in our daily culture. Once these areas have been studied, we can apply it to larger questions begging critical thinking such as how stereotypes of women in films effect their ability to get key roles. 

Keywords:

* Representation 
* Women 
* Bechdel Test
* Hollywood Movies

## Introduction:

Our project, Female Representation on the Big Screen, is centered around the idea that female actors are not being being given equal representation on screen in Hollywood films specifically. Our aim is to use the _Bechdel Test_ as a way to study the patterns of misrepresentation of females in the movie industry. Created by Alison Bechdel in 1985, the Bechdel Test is still relevent today and measures representation by checking three criteria:
- The movie has to have at least 2 [named] female characters
- Who talk to each other
- About something other than a man.
In Hollywood, the majority of A-list actors, directors, and writers are men. This has led to their biases of women tainting the film industry and affecting broader issues such as unequal pay, key roles, and the reinforcement of stereotypes. We all have our favourite female actors or even directors, but few people are aware of the lack of credit they recieve and the major wasting of their greater potential simply due to Hollywood patriarchy.

## Design Situation:

##### **Project Framing:** The problem that is of concern here is the discriminatory actions taken against woman in the movie industry. The key issues on hand here are the pay gaps that has lasted decades and still effects up and coming actress and already established ones. Bringing this information to light will show a clear line between how women are discriminated and the actions needed to be taken to fix it.

##### **Human Values:** The human values that are being represented can be quite clear such as sexism that stems from the overall leadership representation of majority men and the hostile work environment that these woman have to endure since this is their work place. Other human values can be the ability to have equal access to things such as power, resources and opportunities. Being fairly treated and respected allows women to be able to have these things at the same rate as men - but that is not the case in the movie industry.

##### **Direct and Indirect Stakeholders:** The direct stakeholders are the women in the Hollywood who are being taken advantage of in all regards by men in power. From all levels in film-making, women of all skills and back grounds more or less are still treated unfairly. The key motivation for women being treated fairly is the fact that this is their vocation and something they enjoy doing. Women in this industry hold the value of wanting to simply be respected by fellow film makers. The indirect stakeholders in our research would be movie goers who watch their favorite actress or director who don't know that they are being discriminated against and might not appear in the movie they watch.

###### **Harms and Benefits:** The benefits of this research is very wide spreed across not only gender inequality for women but for all people that discriminated against in the movie industry. it isn't clear where the harm might be or if there are any.

## Research questions:
* **How profitable is a movie depending on its Bechdel Test score?**

This is a important because being able to understand the reasoning being hind the women not receiving the same pay as men will help us understand where the root of the problem is at and how to fix it

* **Which of the three test requirements have the highest number of failed results?**

This question is important because it highlights the leadership problem in filmmaking where most decisions are made. Asking questions and diving deep into why women are absent from key positions in the industry will help shed light on why men are favored in certain circumstances.

* **How have Bechdel Test scores changed between 1950-2021?**

* **Application and Critical Thinking: How do stereotypes of women in films affect their ability to attain key roles?**

This question is important because of the long standing belief that women cant be the star of movies unless there's a romantic element or that they have to be the ones being saved, this has long standing effects to young women that grow up thinking that it is all they will ever be. This also has effects on how directors and writers are picked as well as how much women are paid compared to their male counterparts.
